Questions:-
1. What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
2. How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
3. What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?
4. What's our average order value?
5. What is the Total Revenue generated?


Process:-
1) Imported the Data in Tableau 
2) Created different Visuals and calculated feild using formula
3) Created insightful dashboard 


Overview:-

Total Revenue: The pizza sales generated a total revenue of 850,636, with the "classic" pizza type contributing the highest revenue, followed by the "supreme" category. The "veggie" category was the least sold.

Day-wise Sales Trend: Pizzas were most popular on Fridays, followed by Thursdays and Saturdays. This trend suggests a potential correlation with end-of-week gatherings and celebrations, as Friday is typically the last working day for many, encouraging customers to dine out or order in.

Category Sales Insights: The "classic" category had the highest order count, while the "chicken" category had the lowest. This difference may indicate a pricing effect, where "classic" pizzas are likely priced more affordably compared to "chicken" pizzas, which could be a premium offering.

Peak Sale Hours: The busiest times for pizza sales were observed around 12 PM and 6 PM, aligning with typical lunch and dinner times.
